# automotive-2.0
I wrote code to download movies from an illegal streaming  website. Enjoy




# How To:

* 1. Start the program and enter the movie name
* 2. Setup your browser proxy to connect to *:8080 (basicly one click with Foxy Proxy)
* 3. Play the movie normaly until the program starts downloading (This should be instant from pressing play on the movie)
* 4. Enjoy!
 
   

The site just lets you stream basicly any movie or show you want. I've done this on another site, but they fix bug, not really - they just made it harder also there selection was ... meh.
This site the code works on is a big, and very populare site. Theres a Cloudflare WAF along with a bunch of anti-dubugging techniques being used. unfortunately for them, I learnd that
with enough effort and time - anything is possible with code.
