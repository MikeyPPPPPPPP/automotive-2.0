# automotive-2.0
I wrote code to download movies from an illegal piracy streaming  website. Enjoy

The site just lets you stream basicly any movie or show you want. I've done this on another site, but they fix bug, not really - they just made it harder also there selection was ... meh.
This site the code works on is a big, and very populare site. Theres a Cloudflare WAF along with a bunch of anti-dubugging techniques being used. unfortunately for them, I learnd that
with enough effort and time - anything is possible with code.
